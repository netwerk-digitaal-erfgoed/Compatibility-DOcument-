We received many questions from suppliers on persistent identification. For your convenience we have compiled the following overview that uses ARK and handle.net as an example.

The anatomy of an ARK persistent identifier is comparable to that of Handle. 

In `ark:/60537/by6i35` the `60537` uniquely represents the institution (in this case "'Gouda Time Machine") en `by6i35` is the identifier that Gouda Time Machine allocated to the digital resource. You are free in the way you generate the identifier as long as it is independent of the software system. The identifier is persistently linked to the resource, and must be able to migrate to any other platform in the future.   

Handle uses the same pattern. In `handle:/10648/b017027e-d0b4-102d-bcf8-003048976d84` the `10648` identifies the institution (in this case the National Archive of the Netherlands) and `b017027e-d0b4-102d-bcf8-003048976d84` is the GUID they created. 

To find these identifiers you need a resolver. A resolver is a software service that runs at a specific web address, which you can ask where an identifier can be found. 

The ARK resolver is [https://n2t.net/](https://n2t.net/) while Handle identifiers can be resolved through [http://hdl.handle.net/](http://hdl.handle.net/). How resolution works, is the main difference between ARK and Handle. 

ARK is a decentralised system and redirects [https://n2t.net/ark:/60537/by6i35](https://n2t.net/ark:/60537/by6i35)  with an HTTP 302 status code to [https://www.goudatijdmachine.nl/ark:/60537/by6i35](https://www.goudatijdmachine.nl/ark:/60537/by6i35) at that point `goudatijdmachine.nl` is responsible for further internal resolution and redirection of the request to the proper current URL of the resource. The developers of the website implemented a service that redirects the request with another HTTP 302 status code to: [https://www.goudatijdmachine.nl/omeka/s/data/item/31488](https://www.goudatijdmachine.nl/omeka/s/data/item/31488) The ARK Alliance organisation, who maintains the ARK PID system, only stores identifiers of organisations, not of the individual resources. ARK expects you to handle those yourself.

Handle on the other hand is a centralised system. You not only join as an organisation, you also register every individual PID to all your resources. Resolving a request on [http://hdl.handle.net/10648/b017027e-d0b4-102d-bcf8-003048976d84](http://hdl.handle.net/10648/b017027e-d0b4-102d-bcf8-003048976d84) will point the user with a single redirect HTTP 302 to [https://www.nationaalarchief.nl/onderzoeken/fotocollectie/b017027e-d0b4-102d-bcf8-003048976d84](https://www.nationaalarchief.nl/onderzoeken/fotocollectie/b017027e-d0b4-102d-bcf8-003048976d84). The advantage is that the site `nationaalarchief.nl` does not need to host a second resolving service. But this comes at a cost. Not only do you pay an annual fee for using handle, you also have to maintain the PIDs in the handle registry. You must file any changes to the redirect URLs to avoid breaking links.
